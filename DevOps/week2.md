# 01 Extreme Programming Framework:
Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development framework, which emphasizes teamwork, communication, simplicity, and customer feedback. It is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that aim to provide high-quality software, faster and more efficiently. XP incorporates practices like Test-driven development, Pair programming, Continuous integration, and collective code ownership.

# 02 Pair Programming and its Benefits:
Pair Programming is an Agile development technique in which two programmers work together on the same codebase at the same time. It helps to improve code quality, reduce defects, and increase knowledge sharing among team members. Pair programming also enhances collaboration and communication between developers, leading to faster problem-solving and better decision-making.

# 03 Git Repository Guidelines in Agile Development:
In Agile development, Git repositories are essential for version control and collaborative code management. Git guidelines in Agile development involve using branches, pull requests, code reviews, and automated testing to ensure code quality, security, and scalability. These guidelines help to prevent conflicts, manage code changes efficiently, and maintain a robust codebase.

# 04 Benefits of working in Batches in Agile:
Working in Batches is an Agile development practice that involves breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. It helps to reduce complexity, increase productivity, and promote continuous improvement. Batching enables teams to prioritize work, collaborate better, and deliver value more frequently, leading to faster time-to-market and better customer satisfaction.

# 05 What Exactly is MVP? (Minimum Viable Product):
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a development strategy that emphasizes delivering the minimum set of features that can satisfy customer needs and provide value. It is a product development approach that focuses on testing and validating the market before investing too much time and money. MVP enables teams to get feedback early, iterate quickly, and make informed decisions based on customer feedback.

# 06 Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD); and difference between them:
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an Agile development approach that involves writing tests before writing code. It helps to improve code quality, reduce defects, and increase customer satisfaction. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an extension of TDD, which focuses on defining software behavior in natural language before writing code. The main difference between TDD and BDD is that TDD is focused on testing code, while BDD is focused on defining behavior.

# 07 Why is TDD Important for DevOps?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is essential for DevOps because it helps to ensure code quality, reduce defects, and increase automation. TDD enables teams to catch defects early, automate testing, and provide continuous feedback, leading to faster releases and higher customer satisfaction. TDD also promotes collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement, which are essential for successful DevOps practices.

# 08 What are Cloud Native Microservices?
Cloud Native Microservices are a software development approach that involves building small, independent, and scalable services that can run in the cloud. These services are designed to be loosely coupled, highly available, and fault-tolerant. Cloud Native Microservices enable teams to deploy and scale services independently, reduce complexity, and increase agility, leading to faster time-to-market and better customer satisfaction.

## - Moving from legacy infrastructure & architecture to microservices.
Deciding between microservices or legacy infrastructure for a project depends on several factors, such as the complexity of the project, the scalability requirements, the development team's skills, and the business needs.

Legacy infrastructure may be suitable for smaller projects with simpler requirements, where a monolithic architecture can be easily maintained and updated. It may also be appropriate for organizations with limited resources or teams with less experience in microservices development.

On the other hand, microservices architecture is suitable for large, complex projects that require scalability, flexibility, and high performance. Microservices can help organizations build and maintain large-scale applications with agility and speed by breaking the application down into smaller, loosely coupled components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices are also ideal for organizations that require a high degree of customization, have diverse business requirements, or want to leverage cloud technologies.

# 09 Designing for Failure in DevOps:
Designing for failure is a DevOps practice that involves anticipating and preparing for potential failures in the system. It helps to improve reliability, reduce downtime, and increase customer satisfaction. Designing for failure involves using techniques like fault injection, chaos engineering, and disaster recovery planning. These techniques enable teams to identify and fix issues quickly, automate recovery, and ensure business continuity.

# 10 What is Taylorism?
Taylorism emphasizes breaking down work processes into their smallest parts and analyzing them to identify the most efficient way to perform each task. This involves studying every aspect of work, including tools, techniques, and worker behavior, to identify ways to improve efficiency and productivity.

One of the key principles of Taylorism is the separation of planning and execution. In this approach, managers plan the work processes and workers are responsible for executing them. Taylor believed that this division of labor would lead to increased productivity and efficiency.
