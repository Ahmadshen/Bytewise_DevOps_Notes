# 1 Kanban and Kaban Board
- A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. 
- Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

### Elements of Kanban
Kanban boards have five essential elements: visual signals, columns, work-in-progress (WIP) limits, a commitment point, and a delivery point. 

Visual signals refer to cards or tickets that represent work items or projects. 

Columns represent stages of a workflow, such as to-do, in progress, or complete. 
WIP limits specify the maximum number of cards allowed in a column at one time, helping to expose bottlenecks in the workflow.

The commitment point is where an idea or project is picked up by the team, and the delivery point is where the final product or service is delivered to the customer.

The goal of kanban teams is to minimize lead time by continuously improving their workflow.

# 2 Core Principles of Kanban

- 1 Start with what you do now.

- 2 Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change

- 3 Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles

- 4 Encourage acts of leadership at all levels in your organization

#### The Kanban principles include starting with the current process, agreeing to pursue incremental change, respecting current roles and responsibilities, and encouraging acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. Kanban is designed to gently improve legacy processes, without disrupting the underlying framework. It promotes a culture of collaboration, where anyone can take ownership of an issue and address it, and encourages acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. By doing so, Kanban empowers team members to take risks, grow professionally, and make a positive impact on the organization.

# 3 Scrum Overview
- Agile and scrum are not the same.
- Agile is a philosophy of doing work.
- Scrum is a methodology for doing work in an agile manner.
- 
# What is scrum?

- It is a management framework for incremental product development.
- It emphasizes working in small, cross-functional teams.
- Provides a structure of rules, roles, and artifacts.
- Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints.
- Has a goal to build a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration.
- 
# Sprint

- A sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test, and deployment cycle.
- Every sprint should have a goal.
- Sprints are usually 2 weeks in duration.

# Roles in Scrum
## Product Owner
- Represents the stakeholder interests.
- Articulate product vision.
- Is the final arbiter of requirements questions.
- Constantly re-prioritizes the product backlog, adjusting any expectations.
- Accepts or rejects each product increment.
- Decides whether to ship.
- Decides whether to continue development.
## Scrum Master
- Facilitates the Scrum process.
- Coaches the team.
- Creates an environment to allow the team to be self-organizing.
- Shields the team from external interference to keep it in the zone.
- Help resolve impediments.
- Enforces sprint timeboxes.
- Captures empirical data to adjust forecasts.
- Has no management authority over the team.
## Scrum Team
- A cross-functional team consisting of developers, testers, business analysts,
domain experts, and others.
- Self-organizing team with no externally assigned roles.
- Self-managing as they self-assign their work.
- Usually consists of 5-9 collaborative members.
- Co-located.
- Dedicated.
- Negotiate commitments with the product owner.

# 4 Benefits of Scrum

Increased productivity: Scrum helps teams focus on completing small, achievable goals and delivering working software in short iterations, which improves productivity and reduces waste.

Better collaboration: Scrum encourages collaboration among team members and stakeholders, which leads to better communication, alignment, and understanding of project goals.

Greater transparency: Scrum provides transparency into project progress, work completed, and upcoming tasks, which helps stakeholders make informed decisions and identify potential issues early.

Improved flexibility: Scrum allows teams to adjust to changing requirements, priorities, and market conditions, which makes it easier to respond to customer needs and stay ahead of the competition.

Faster time to market: Scrum's iterative and incremental approach allows teams to deliver working software early and often, which reduces time to market and improves customer satisfaction.

Enhanced quality: Scrum emphasizes testing, continuous integration, and continuous improvement, which results in higher-quality software that meets user needs and expectations.

Better risk management: Scrum provides a structured framework for identifying and managing project risks, which reduces the likelihood of costly surprises and delays.

Increased team motivation: Scrum's focus on self-organization, collaboration, and continuous improvement helps teams feel empowered, engaged, and motivated to deliver high-quality results.

Improved stakeholder satisfaction: Scrum's focus on delivering working software frequently and involving stakeholders in the process leads to better alignment, feedback, and satisfaction.

More efficient use of resources: Scrum's iterative and incremental approach enables teams to prioritize and focus on the most important work, which maximizes the use of limited resources and reduces waste.

# 5 User Stories, Story Points, INVEST and Epic
User stories are a way of expressing software requirements from the perspective of an end-user or customer. They are typically written in a simple, structured format that describes what a user wants to accomplish and why. Story points are a way of estimating the relative size and complexity of a user story, using a numerical scale that reflects the amount of work involved.  

### User Stories:
- Story Contents
- Brief description of need and business value.
- Any assumptions or details?
- The definition of “Done”.
- Given some conditions.
- Gherkin syntax is used

### The INVEST characteristics of a user story are:

- Independent: the story can be worked on and completed independently of other stories
- Negotiable: the details of the story can be discussed and refined as necessary
- Valuable: the story delivers value to the user or customer
- Estimable: the story can be estimated in terms of effort or complexity
- Small: the story is small enough to be completed in a single sprint
- Testable: the story can be tested to confirm that it meets the acceptance criteria

### Epic
An epic is a large, high-level user story that is too big to be completed in a single sprint. Epics are typically broken down into smaller, more manageable stories called "features" or "stories" that can be worked on within a sprint.
- A big idea
- A user story that is bigger than a single sprint
- Backlogs usually start as epics and become stories when defined
- For sprint planning, Epics need to be broken into stories

### Effectively Using Story Points
- The story point is an abstract measure of the overall effort.
- Used to measure the difficulty of implementing a user story.
- Story points acknowledge that humans are bad at estimating time-to-completion.
- Story points are like T-Shirt sizes.
- Most tools use the Fibonacci series.
- Since story points are relative, you will have to agree on what a particular size is.
## - Story Size
- A story should be small enough to be coded and tested in a single sprint
iteration, ideally, just a few days.
- Large stories should be broken down into smaller ones.
## - Story point anti-pattern
- Evaluating a story to wall-clock time.
- Humans are bad at estimating wall clock time.

# 6&7 Sprint, Product Backlog, Backlog Refinement 
## Sprint
- A sprint is a time-boxed period during which a development team works to complete a set of user stories. The length of a sprint can vary, but it is typically between one and four weeks.

## Building the Product Backlog
- The product backlog contains all the unimplemented stories not in a sprint.
- Stories are ranked in order of importance or business value.
- Series are more detailed at the top, and less detailed at the bottom.
- Sample requirements
- As a …
- I need …
- So that …
## - Lesson Summary - User Stories:
● A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.
● Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete.
● Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings.
● Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent,
negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.
● Epics can be used to capture big ideas.
● Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user
story.
● Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes.
● You must agree on what "average" means.
● You should never equate story points with wall clock time.
● A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories.
● Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower.
● Create stories using the "As a", "I need", and "So that" template to ensure everyone
understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.


## Backlog Refinement
- Keep important stories on top.
- Break large stories near the top into smaller ones.
- Make sure that stories near the top of the backlog are groomed and complete.
### - Backlog refinement meeting:
#### - Who should attend?
- Product owner.
- Scrum master.
- Development team (optional and only one of them would be enough)
#### - What is the goal?
- Groom the backlog by ranking the stories in order of importance.
- Make sure the story contains enough information for a developer to start
working on it.
### - New Issue Triage
- Start with new issue triage.
- Goal: At the end of backlog refinement, the New Issues column is empty.
- Take stories from new issues and move them into product backlog or icebox if of
less priority. You can also reject them.
### - Backlog refinement workflow
- The product owner sorts the product log in order of importance.
- The team may provide estimates and other technical information.
- Large vague items are split and clarified.
- The goal is to make stories “sprint ready”.
### - Labels
- Labels in GitHub
- The yellow label should be for the technical dept as well.
#### - Examples of Technical Debt:
- Code refactoring.
- Set up and maintain environments.
- Changing technology, like databases.
- Updating vulnerable libraries.
#### - Backlog refinement tips
- Refine backlog every sprint to ensure the priorities are correct.
- Have at least two sprints’ worth of stories groomed.
