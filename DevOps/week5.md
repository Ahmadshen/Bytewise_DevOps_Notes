# 1 Kanban and Kaban Board
## A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. 
## Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

### Elements of Kanban
Kanban boards have five essential elements: visual signals, columns, work-in-progress (WIP) limits, a commitment point, and a delivery point. 

Visual signals refer to cards or tickets that represent work items or projects. 

Columns represent stages of a workflow, such as to-do, in progress, or complete. 
WIP limits specify the maximum number of cards allowed in a column at one time, helping to expose bottlenecks in the workflow.

The commitment point is where an idea or project is picked up by the team, and the delivery point is where the final product or service is delivered to the customer.

The goal of kanban teams is to minimize lead time by continuously improving their workflow.

# 2 Core Principles of Kanban

### 1 Start with what you do now.

### 2 Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change

### 3 Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles

### 4 Encourage acts of leadership at all levels in your organization

#### The Kanban principles include starting with the current process, agreeing to pursue incremental change, respecting current roles and responsibilities, and encouraging acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. Kanban is designed to gently improve legacy processes, without disrupting the underlying framework. It promotes a culture of collaboration, where anyone can take ownership of an issue and address it, and encourages acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. By doing so, Kanban empowers team members to take risks, grow professionally, and make a positive impact on the organization.

# 3 Scrum Overview
- Agile and scrum are not the same.
- Agile is a philosophy of doing work.
- Scrum is a methodology for doing work in an agile manner.
- 
# What is scrum?

- It is a management framework for incremental product development.
- It emphasizes working in small, cross-functional teams.
- Provides a structure of rules, roles, and artifacts.
- Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints.
- Has a goal to build a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration.
- 
# Sprint

- A sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test, and deployment cycle.
- Every sprint should have a goal.
- Sprints are usually 2 weeks in duration.

# Roles in Scrum
## Product Owner
- Represents the stakeholder interests.
- Articulate product vision.
- Is the final arbiter of requirements questions.
- Constantly re-prioritizes the product backlog, adjusting any expectations.
- Accepts or rejects each product increment.
- Decides whether to ship.
- Decides whether to continue development.
## Scrum Master
- Facilitates the Scrum process.
- Coaches the team.
- Creates an environment to allow the team to be self-organizing.
- Shields the team from external interference to keep it in the zone.
- Help resolve impediments.
- Enforces sprint timeboxes.
- Captures empirical data to adjust forecasts.
- Has no management authority over the team.
## Scrum Team
- A cross-functional team consisting of developers, testers, business analysts,

- Self-organizing team with no externally assigned roles.

- Usually consists of 5-9 collaborative members.
- Co-located.

- Negotiate commitments with the product owner.

# 4 Benefits of Scrum

Increased productivity: Scrum helps teams focus on completing small, achievable goals and delivering working software in short iterations, which improves productivity and reduces waste.

Better collaboration: Scrum encourages collaboration among team members and stakeholders, which leads to better communication, alignment, and understanding of project goals.

Greater transparency: Scrum provides transparency into project progress, work completed, and upcoming tasks, which helps stakeholders make informed decisions and identify potential issues early.

Improved flexibility: Scrum allows teams to adjust to changing requirements, priorities, and market conditions, which makes it easier to respond to customer needs and stay ahead of the competition.

Faster time to market: Scrum's iterative and incremental approach allows teams to deliver working software early and often, which reduces time to market and improves customer satisfaction.

Enhanced quality: Scrum emphasizes testing, continuous integration, and continuous improvement, which results in higher-quality software that meets user needs and expectations.

Better risk management: Scrum provides a structured framework for identifying and managing project risks, which reduces the likelihood of costly surprises and delays.

Increased team motivation: Scrum's focus on self-organization, collaboration, and continuous improvement helps teams feel empowered, engaged, and motivated to deliver high-quality results.

Improved stakeholder satisfaction: Scrum's focus on delivering working software frequently and involving stakeholders in the process leads to better alignment, feedback, and satisfaction.

More efficient use of resources: Scrum's iterative and incremental approach enables teams to prioritize and focus on the most important work, which maximizes the use of limited resources and reduces waste.
