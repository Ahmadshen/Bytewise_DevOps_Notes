# 1 Kanban and Kaban Board
## A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. 
## Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

### Elements of Kanban
Kanban boards have five essential elements: visual signals, columns, work-in-progress (WIP) limits, a commitment point, and a delivery point. 

Visual signals refer to cards or tickets that represent work items or projects. 

Columns represent stages of a workflow, such as to-do, in progress, or complete. 
WIP limits specify the maximum number of cards allowed in a column at one time, helping to expose bottlenecks in the workflow.

The commitment point is where an idea or project is picked up by the team, and the delivery point is where the final product or service is delivered to the customer.

The goal of kanban teams is to minimize lead time by continuously improving their workflow.

# 2 Core Principles of Kanban

1 Start with what you do now.

2 Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change

3 Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities, and titles

4 Encourage acts of leadership at all levels in your organization

The Kanban principles include starting with the current process, agreeing to pursue incremental change, respecting current roles and responsibilities, and encouraging acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. Kanban is designed to gently improve legacy processes, without disrupting the underlying framework. It promotes a culture of collaboration, where anyone can take ownership of an issue and address it, and encourages acts of leadership at all levels of the organization. By doing so, Kanban empowers team members to take risks, grow professionally, and make a positive impact on the organization.
